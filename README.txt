Introduction
============

MooBot is part of an experiment. Inspired by rumours of a bot called Hubot,
which sits at the CampFire and does your bidding, and frustrated with Nagios
and my own forgetful nature, I came up with moobot. It is an IRC bot that
can be extended with plugins. The idea is to do system monitoring and other
system related jobs using an IRC server as a messaging bus.

Its called moobot because at 1AM in the morning, that sounded better than
monbot.
